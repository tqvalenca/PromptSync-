# PromptSync

**Intelligent synchronization between ChatGPT (LLM) and your daily schedule.**

PromptSync is an innovative solution that connects large language models like ChatGPT with personal productivity tools — such as Google Calendar, Google Tasks, and other scheduling/task apps — to automate, plan, sync, and organize your daily routine.

> **Automate your day. Manage events and tasks. Get smart feedback. Sync with ease.**
